## Help!
Sky, the elemental sprite, stumbled through the wrong portal and can't get home! Collect all the crystals to reactivate the portal and get her home safely. But beware - the evil vorax are attracted to the crystals and will do anything to stop you from taking them. Toggle between Sky's different elemental states and abilties to avoid and defeat the vorax!

Sky's Odyssey is a 2D Platform game I created as an assignment for my COMP_SCI 376-0 Game Design class in about a week and a half. It follows Sky, a lost elemental sprite and her journey to get home.

I really enjoyed the design focus of this game, and building a story and motive around the player and characters. I did find that I had to put in more work in balancing the difficulty of the game, which was more intricate than I expected. I especially enjoyed learning how to create the short cutscene at the end, as I thought it was really fun.

Sky's story is resolved at the end of the game, but maybe I'll add to her adventures in the future.
## Design
This assignment involved more planning and design work than previous ones. I created aesthetic goals and core loops before programming, and tried to build a narrative surrounding the game. More design details can be found in the devlog.
### Aesthetic Goals
### Core Loop

## Gameplay
This game is intended to be played with a keyboard. There are additional instructions in the INSTRUCTIONS.txt file.
* Use the arrows or WASD keys to move.
* Press TAB to toggle between elemental states. Each element has a different ability.
    * Water ability: Shield
    * Air ability: Fly/Double jump
    * Fire ability: Shoot a circle of fireballs
* Collect all 25 crystals and go through the portal to get Sky home and win.
* The vorax will shoot tracking projectiles if you get too close - avoid them, or deflect them with a shield or fireball.
* Hitting a vorax with three fireballs will defeat it.
* You will lose health if you collide with a vorax, or are hit by a vorax projectile. If you run out of health, you lose.

## Build
A build for this game is available under releases.

Alternatively, you can open the project within the Unity Editor. It uses Unity 2022.3.10f1. Open the "MainMenu" scene to start the game.
